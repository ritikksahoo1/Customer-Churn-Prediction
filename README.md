# Customer-Churn-Prediction

The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022

Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

The Zip Code Population table contains complimentary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table

We need to predict whether the customer will churn, stay or join the company based on the parameters of the dataset.
